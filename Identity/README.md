**Project Rationale:**
The concept for the Once A Year Food Festival was born from a desire to celebrate the diversity and cultural significance of foods that are traditionally prepared and consumed only once a year. Across the world, many cultures reserve special dishes for annual festivals, religious celebrations, or seasonal events, imbuing these foods with rich symbolism and emotional meaning. I wanted to create a festival that not only brings these rare culinary traditions into one place but also educates attendees about the stories, customs, and values behind each dish.

The name Once A Year was chosen to reflect the festival’s core idea — these are not everyday meals but extraordinary foods tied to significant moments in people’s lives. To ensure authenticity and respect for cultural practices, the festival features a curated selection of dishes, with each vendor or chef representing a particular tradition or celebration.

By creating Once A Year, I aimed to provide a space where food becomes a gateway to exploring global traditions and fostering cross-cultural appreciation. The festival not only satisfies culinary curiosity but also highlights the ways food binds communities, honors heritage, and marks the passage of time. Ultimately, Once A Year is about savoring not just flavors, but the cultural richness they represent a rare, meaningful experience that captures the spirit of global festivity.
