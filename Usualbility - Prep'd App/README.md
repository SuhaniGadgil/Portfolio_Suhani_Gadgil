# Prep'd Cooking Class App
**Individual and Group Tasks**

**Project Overview:**

Working in a small group and individually, the aim is to design and deliver a protoype of a mobile application that allows specific users to achieve specific tasks. 

Through a series of design stages tasks were completed to ensure that the project applies principles and theroy to improve the user experience of the application.

**Project Brief:**
Mobile applications are used by different types of people to easily complete goals. A well designed application can allow even a novice user to navigate and manage complex information utilising many different features of a modern mobile phone. 

Many people want to learn to cook or bake for a variety of reasons, but do not have anyone to teach them. Some turn to searching for recipes online, but are overwhelmed by the sheer number available and the unnecessary additional information or complex procedures many of these recipes include.

The aim of this project is to design a mobile application that allows users to search for online cooking classes based on format and category and view or book into a cooking class, where they can participate and receive feedback on their
progress.
