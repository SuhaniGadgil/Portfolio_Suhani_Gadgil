# Redesigning Website
**Individual:** Suhani Gadgil

**Project Overview:**

This is a redesign project of a florist in NSW called DENILIQUIN FLORIST. Initially the design on the original website was very basic and many tabs or information was not organised or presented in a user friendly manner, hence the goal was to enhance its overall appearance and features. 

This is a very basic redesign of the website as this was a first year project so as students we were instructed to use templates to re-create the website.

All files can be found in their relevant folders.
