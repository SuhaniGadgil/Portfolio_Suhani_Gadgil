# Suhani Gadgil's Portfolio
**Individual:** Suhani Gadgil

**Project Overview:**

Over the past three years, I have undertaken a diverse range of projects that span user experience design, software development, animation, and branding. My portfolio demonstrates both creative and technical competencies developed through academic and personal work.

UX Design Projects
I’ve led the end-to-end design of several user-centred applications, including The Rubbish App and Prep’d App, which address real-world challenges like household task management and cooking class bookings. Both projects involved user research, usability testing, and prototyping with accessibility in mind.

Development Projects
From front-end development of the DENILIQUIN_FLORIST_website to building an Event Management Android Application, I’ve applied programming and interaction design skills to deliver functional digital products. My SantoriniGame project demonstrates object-oriented principles and game logic implementation using Java.

Branding & Identity Design
In Identity – Once A Year, I explored the creation of a cultural food festival identity system, integrating type, colour theory, and visual storytelling. This was supported by thorough rationale and application mockups.

Typography & Publication Design
Through Motion Animation, Publication, and Typography Publication, I developed a deep understanding of typographic principles, grid systems, and dynamic layouts. These projects helped me refine visual hierarchy and communication design techniques.

Usability & Systems Prototyping
My work in Systems Development and UX Project NOOK showcases my experience with iterative prototyping and usability evaluation methods. These were grounded in ISO standards and design heuristics, demonstrating both analytical and practical skills.

Each project reflects my evolving capabilities across disciplines. I take pride in crafting purposeful and well-researched outcomes, and I’m eager to apply these experiences in industry settings where design and technology intersect.
