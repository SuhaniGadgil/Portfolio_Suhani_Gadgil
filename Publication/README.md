# What is pain - Motion Animation

**Project Rationale:**
The aim of this project is to create a one-minute animated explainer video about pain for The Alfred Hospital. The communication goal is to clearly and effectively convey information about pain management to an adult audience (18+), aligning closely with the provided script while remaining visually informative and easy to understand.
The theme focuses on educational healthcare communication. To ensure the video feels consistent with The Alfred Hospital’s existing brand, I based the colour palette on the colours used in their website and digital materials. This helps the animation feel authentic and familiar to the hospital’s audience.
For the visual strategy, I adopted a clean, simple illustrative style. The illustrations are stripped back, avoiding unnecessary detail, to help viewers focus directly on the key information being presented. This minimalistic approach supports the voiceover narration and ensures that the animation remains easy to follow without visual distraction.
Overall, the final design aims to present information clearly and professionally while reflecting The Alfred Hospital’s branding and maintaining accessibility for a broad adult audience.

Software that was used to make this short video was Adobe After Effects, Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop.
