# Typography Publication

**Project Brief:**
For this project it required the use one of Rawsthornâ€™s weekly topics to form the basis of a small publication project. Using the text supplied, the task was to design an informative publication on the topic, supported by imagery and organised in a way which reimagines the content in a printed form. Republishing these posts in print transforms the ephemeral nature of internet content into a more lasting and curated historical record. Time was taken to read the text and further research the subject and its design epoch. This will helped to make informed decisions on colour palette and type selection.
