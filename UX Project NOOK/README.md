# Prep'd Cooking Class App
**Individual and Group Tasks**

**Project Overview:**

Working in a small group and individually, the aim is to design and deliver a protoype of a mobile application that allows specific users to achieve specific tasks. 

Through a series of design stages tasks were completed to ensure that the project applies principles and theroy to improve the user experience of the application.

**Project Brief:**
Design a digital wayfinding system for the Monash Caulfield Campus. This design task requires to consolidate ideas around the spatial (physical) experience, and the digital, in order to introduce digitally-augmented layers of interactive information into the campus environment. 

There are two key touchpoints to consider â€“ the mobile device and digital signage. 

Responses to the brief is not be about replacing ALL existing physical wayfinding markers currently in the campus. Instead, the proposal should be seen as a complementary digital system that enhances and resonates with the current visitor experience in terms of efficiency, comfort, and community. T

he outcomes (details below) are a Figma interactive mobile application prototype, along with relevant site-specific digital signage Figma mockups designed in a visually and interactively consistent manner. into a cooking class, where they can participate and receive feedback on their
progress.
