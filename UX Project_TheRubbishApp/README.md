# The Rubbish App
**Individual:** Suhani Gadgil

**Project Overview:**

This project was my first proper introduction to UX/UI Design. The goal was to develop a single-function mobile app that engages with the theme of **Trash**. The objective of the app is to simply allow the described objective to be executed with the help of a digital mobile application. The target was to have Android as the final platform. 

Theme:
- Trash: a way for housemates to remind when it's their turn to take out the trash/ recycling ect.

As the design was created under a six week timeline there are no more than five screens created, making the project focus on the fucntionality.
